<h2>Welcome To My Programming Blog</h2>

My name is Catherine. And in this blog I will be talking about my programming project and the work in progress while making it. I started out by setting up my assets first and making sure everything imported into Flash correctly.
After I imported my assets in. I tweaked them around and made sure that they were organised correctly. Then I made them into symbols. I named them according to what they were and checked the Export for ActionScript box and that the class names were the same as the symbol.
Then I used code and added two event listeners (KeyboardEvent:KEY_DOWN) so that when I pressed the right arrow key and the left arrow key that the character would move in that direction by increments of 5 px. I also used the scale.x property so the character is facing in the right direction when the key is pressed.
However I did encounter a few small problems while doing this. I found out that my frames and order of the symbols aren't arranged properly so I'll be continuing working on the code with simplier symbols while fixing this problem.
The backgrounds are set up alright enough. It's just the character assets and frames that need tweaking.

Following on from that I decided that I would create a simpler symbol to work with as the character. This is because the layers and frames of the character were not laid out correctly, and that could interfere with MovieClip playback. So I created a simple ball symbol with several frames and symbols of several conditions it's in (walking, turn cycle, jumping, etc). This would allow me to access the different frames and properties of the ball symbol. Then it should be ok enough, when I replace it with the fixed character.
This then allowed me to focus more on the background layers. I had each different layer as it's own symbol (except for the stalactite collision detection). This allowed me to effect each layer individually.
I added an another event listener (KeyboardEvent:KEY_DOWN) so that when I hit the left and right arrow keys the background layers moved at different different increments (5px, 10px etc.), so that the foreground moved a lot faster than the background for example.
I am currently working on the dead zone and parallax implementation.
Some obstacles I came across where keeping my naming conventions consistant and this effecting the outcome of the interactivity as well.
